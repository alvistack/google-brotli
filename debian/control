Description: Brotli compression format
 Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that
 compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77
 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a
 compression ratio comparable to the best currently available
 general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate
 but offers more dense compression.
